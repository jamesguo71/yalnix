# Yalnix - Team Unics
This repository contains our (Fei & Taylor) code for the COSC258 Yalnix project.

# Checkpoint 3
Use the following command to build and run our solution:

```bash
make && ./yalnix
```

If no init program is provided, we will run our `./user/init` program by default. You can also run our test program, which invokes the three syscalls we implemented (`GetPid`, `Delay`, and `Brk`):

```bash
./yalnix ./user/chpt3_test
```
