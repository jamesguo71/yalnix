# Yalnix - Team Unics
This repository contains our (Fei & Taylor) code for the COSC258 Yalnix project.

# Checkpoint 4

For this checkpoint, we implemented the following functions and some other helper functions.
```bash
Fork
Exec
Exit
Wait
TrapKernel
TrapIllegal
TrapMemory
TrapMath

```

Use the following command to build and run our solution:

```bash
make && ./yalnix
``` 
You can run our test programs in this way:
```
./yalnix ./user/fork_and_exec
./yalnix ./user/fork_and_exit
./yalnix ./user/fork_and_wait
./yalnix ./user/fork_test
./yalnix ./user/trap_math
./yalnix ./user/trap_memory
```
